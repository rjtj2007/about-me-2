  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Ron Barrantes. I am originally from Costa Rica, but I grew up in North Carolina.</p>
    <p>I went to college in a little town in the midst of the Appalachian mountains called Asheville. It's absolutely gorgeous down there. While I was there I did a little bit of digital media: Some audio, some video, and some web.</p>

    <h2>Stuff I've done</h2>

    <p>I have done a bunch of random stuff throughout my life.<br> These are some of the few</p>

    <ul id="work">
      <li>Worked in a small web design studio called Bedford Falls Graphics</li>
      <li>Exported vehicles to various countries for a family company named American Importadora</li>
      <li>Worked on a super sketchy startup</li>
      <li>Became a dance instructor for Salsa Con Todo in Seattle, with a focus on Salsa, Bachata and Zouk</li>
      <li>Worked at a coffee roasting house</li>
      <li>Helped manage a little site for a Dance Festival in Seattle</li>
      <li>Managing a site for a dance festival in Hawaii</li>
      <li>Working as a Lyft Driver</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>Some of my goals, well… finishing Code Fellows with flying colors, and getting a job in the industry. I would like to open up a Saas business, also having a physical product business. Eventually, one of the things I want to do is have a little foundation
      of some kind to help hispanic and low income kids to go to college.</p>
    <p>If you can’t gather from the text above, I like to talk a lot and I enjoy listening to stories. I love podcast and audiobooks. I love cooking and eating. I am getting into flying drones. I enjoy dancing and being nerdy.
