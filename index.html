    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Ron Barrantes. I am originally from Costa Rica, but I grew up in North Carolina.</p>
    <p>I went to college in a little town in the midst of the Appalachian mountains called Asheville. It's absolutely gorgeous down there. While I was there I did a little bit of digital media: Some audio, some video, and some web.</p>
    <h2>Stuff I've done</h2>
    <p>I have done a bunch of random stuff throughout my life. Many moons ago, I worked in a small web design studio called Bedford Falls Graphics. It was so long ago, we used to create layouts with Tables and navigation with Flash. </p>
    <p>From there I exported vehicles to various countries, in my family's business. It was fun and I learned a lot about how to deal with clients and what not. Right around that time I decided to move to Seattle. After the move I worked on a little startup
      doing some web-y web stuff. Sadly, it didn’t have a clear vision of what it was so we wasted almost a year worth of work. </p>
    <p>I felt I needed a career change, so I became, I became a dance instructor. I taught Salsa, Bachata and Zouk. That was fun. From there I worked at a coffee shop, and then as a Lyft driver. Finally I joined Code Fellows so it feels I am doing a full
      circle.
    </p>
    <h2>My Goals</h2>

    <p>Some of my goals, well… finishing Code Fellows with flying colors, and getting a job in the industry. I would like to open up a Saas business, also having a physical product business. Eventually, one of the things I want to do is have a little foundation
      of some kind to help hispanic and low income kids to go to college.</p>

    <p>If you can’t gather from the text above, I like to talk a lot and I enjoy listening to stories. I love podcast and audiobooks. I love cooking and eating. I am getting into flying drones. I enjoy dancing and being nerdy.
