  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <!-- "As X, I want Y, so that Z" -->

  Hi my name is Ron Barrantes. I am originally from Costa Rica, but I grew up in North Carolina.

  I went to college in a little town in the midst of the Appalachian called Asheville. It's absolutely gorgeous down there. While I was there I did a little bit of digital media: Some audio, some video, and some web.

  I have done a bunch of stuff in regards to employment. Many moons ago, I worked in a small web design studio called Bedford Falls Graphics. It was so long ago, we used to create layouts with Tables and navigation with Flash. From there I exported vehicles to various countries, in my family's business.
