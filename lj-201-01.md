# Learning Journal 201 - Day 02

**Dear Learning Journal**

The main thing that I leaned today is that many of the tags that I thought were relevant are not anymore. To my surprise, a lot of the inline semantic tags such as `b`, `i`, `strong`, `em`, and such could be consider bad practice to use (sometimes). Instead a better practice should be to create a specific tag for the intended purpose of the tag.
The other thing that I learned today was an understanding of the child selector. I haven't figured it out but it finally clicked, I think.

I learned the names of kabob-case and snake_case.

I learned that I didn't hook up my eslint tool properly, but I got it handled.

There are a lot of concepts that I know, the issue is that it has been so long since I have use them that I feel it's going to take for ever to get them back straight. I know what can be done, but I don't know how to do it, and I don't know what I don't know, and that's a different issue altogether.
